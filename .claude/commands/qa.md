description: Re-run desktop QA and auto-correction on the current build
argument-hint: [optional-section-name]

Re-run Phase 3 (Desktop QA) on the current build.

If a section name is provided ($ARGUMENTS), only QA that section. Otherwise, QA all sections.

For each section:
1. Get the Figma screenshot for reference using `get_screenshot`
2. Compare against the built code
3. Check visual fidelity: spacing, typography, colors, layout, border radius, shadows
4. Check code quality: semantic HTML, no hardcoded values, proper types, no unused CSS
5. If any issues found: fix them, then re-check until the section passes

After desktop QA passes, verify the build still compiles with your framework's build command (e.g., `npm run build`).
